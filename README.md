SpaceApps Quito "Volcanoes, Icebergs and Cats from Space" challenge

Description
-----------

The goal is to engage people in looking for interesting natural events using Gamification.

In the given timeframe we managed to build a prototype application consisting of an API, a Web UI and a cross-platform mobile application. 

Main idea is to motivate users not only to share their findings, but also to spend some ime in the application regularly. For this we're planning to add different parameters for rating calculations - not only number of marked events but also:

* Time spent in the app
* "Likes" of events

To improve coverage we're planning to add proper sharing of findings (and also interesting places found by others), but it needs some additional work, and we've decided to polish what we have first.
